# Gatsby | Training

A suite of examples used to demonstrate some concepts for a Gatsby-led training session and introduction to Gatsby.

## Installation

We use a yarn workspace (to minimize duplicate dependencies and quicker installation times!), so installation is as simple as:

1. Fork this repo (so you can commit your changes!)
1. Clone your fork
2. Run `yarn` in the root of your repo

All examples (in the `examples/` directory) will now have their dependencies installed. When working with an example, run `cd examples/{EXAMPLE_HERE}` and use commands as you would normally, e.g. `yarn start`, `yarn build`, etc.

_Note: don't have yarn? That's OK! You'll just need to run `npm install` in each example folder before getting started!_

## Learning

First and foremost, I **strongly** recommend starting with the [official Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/). An example located at [examples/tutorial](./examples/tutorial) has been scaffolded for ease-of-use in getting up and running. It presumes zero existing knowledge of Node.js, Gatsby, and React and there are various learnings paths if you _do_ have that existing knowledge.

Additionally, several examples to re-inforce concepts have been provided to study the code, specifically:

- [Async Requests](./examples/async-requests)
- [Authentication](./examples/authentication)
- [Blog](./examples/blog)
- [React Native Web](./examples/react-native-web)

My advice would be to go through the tutorial, and then attempt to build out a proof of concept for something you're interested in (e.g. a Gatsby app with authentication, a Gatsby app with real-time data calls, etc.) and then we will revisit in several weeks with any outstanding questions or additional resources!
